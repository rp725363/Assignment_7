1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?
Ans:-
The feature responsible for generating reguler expression (Rogex) object is called "Reguler expression pattern"

2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?
Ans:-
Raw string more oftenly used in regular expression objects beacuse reguler expression contains alot of backslashes 
which are specially used for a special purpose in regular exprassion , in regular python string. Each backslash must be escaped 
in order to represent a single backslash.This can make  regular srring diffecult to read and understand , while expression haveing multiple backslashes.

3. What is the return value of the search() method?
Ans:-
In reguler expression search() method returns the matched value anywhere in string ot "None" if there is no match in string .
Example as below:-
import re

string="this is my string rajendra"
pattern=r"rajendra"

match=re.search(pattern,string)

if match:
    print("Match found")
    print("Match text",match.group())
    print("start index",match.start())
    print("end index",match.end())
else:
    print("Not found")
    
    
    4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?
Ans:-
Match basiclly used to matach a string or group of string in regular expression , and here group() method return string that matches
entire pattern.
For example:-
import re

string="this is rajendra pandey"

pattern="rajendra"

match=re.search(pattern,string)

if match:
    print("matched")
else:
    print("not found")
    
by running above code , you will end up getting details as below , here we found a pattern match in string .
output:-
matched

5. In the regex which created from the r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?
Ans:-
Here we can get the match found in digit by using match function in regular expression. examlpe as below.

import re

digit="334-453-5047"  #here we have to fill the digits in patter which we are supposed to match or we have to make a patter as per digit expression
pattern=r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)'

match=re.search(digit,pattern)

if match:
     print(match.group(0))
     print(match.group(1))
     print(match.group(2))
 else:
     print("not found")

if this function fount your pattern or given data matched the output will be matched else it will give you not found error.

6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?
Ans:-
Here in regular expression , special charectors such as parenthess and periods have specific meaning, so to much parenthless and periods you need to escape them using
backslash charectors "\"

for example :
to match a parenthesis '(',use\'(
to match a litrel parenthsis ')',use'\)'
to match a litrel period '.'use'\.'.

so to match a string containing parentheses and periods you would write regular expression as below.

7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?
Ans:-
findall() in python returns list of string or list of tuples , depending on regular expression pattern used.

if regular expression pattern contains no capturing groups findall(), then it will return list of string .
import re
string="rajendra kumar pandey"
pattern="\w+"

result=re.findall(pattern,text)

print(result)

here while using no capturing group , we will find a list of string as output.
 
 If suppos regular exression pattern contains capturing groups findall() will return list of tuples.
 
 As example:-
 import re

text = "apple banana cherry"
pattern = "(\w+) (\w+)(\w+)"

result = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(result)
this will return a list of tuple as output.


8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?
Ans:-
In python language | used to for OR oprator , when it is used in python , it match expression values to left of expression value to right .
example as follows:-
below example will match to apple or banana
apple|banana
